# Learning GO

The aim of this repository is to be my "notebook" for the Golang, currently I am studying this language, so,
there are a lot of small apps based on the book ["Introducting GO"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920046516.do) and challenges from the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/borgesbruno).

Do not forget to set the GOPATH
```export GOPATH=`pwd` ```
